# VIKTOR demo app
Welcome to the source code of the VIKTOR demo app!

This demo has been created to show (beginner) developers how a VIKTOR app looks like and to let them experience various 
of its functionalities in the apps interface.

The source code of this app has been extensively documented (comments, docstrings, links) to teach you the basics of 
writing VIKTOR apps within the code itself. It can be found in `app.py`.

Feel free to play around, change/remove/add app code and watch the outcome of the modifications in the app's interface 
in your browser.

The full VIKTOR documentation can be found at <https://docs.viktor.ai/docs/welcome/>
